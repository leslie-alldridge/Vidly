The complete ASP.NET MVC 5 Course by Mosh

### Goals

Following a few tutorials to refresh my .Net knowledge as I will be working towards changing my main language to .Net in the near future.

Although I can rapidly prototype in React and Python with great confidence, I need to build my .Net knowledge to the point where I can rapidly prototype full stack applications or an API backend service.
